# Post Generator Web App
A web application built with Flask And Google Gemini that allows users to generate posts based on selected topic, length, and language.
The app uses Few-Shot Learning to guide a language model by leveraging past posts with specific attribute(such as topic, length and language).

## Features
Post Generation: Users can select from predefined tags, choose post length (Short, Medium, or Long), and select language (English or Hinglish) to generate a new post.
Few-Shot Learning: Past posts related to specific parameters (topic, length, and language) are used to guide the language model for generating more accurate and contextually relevant posts.
Google Generative AI: The app utilizes Googleâ€™s Generative AI models to generate posts based on user-selected inputs.

## Technical Architecture
Stage 1: Collect LinkedIn Posts
The first stage involves collecting past LinkedIn posts and analyzing them to extract key features, including Topic, Language, and Length.
Stage 2: Generate New Post
The app uses these features (topic, language, and length) to generate a new post.
Few-Shot Learning is applied by using past posts related to a specific topic, language, and length to guide Google Generative AI in producing more accurate content that follows the same style and context.



## Set-up
1. API Key Setup

To interact with Google Generative AI API, you need to create a Google Cloud project and obtain an API key.

Steps to get your API key:
